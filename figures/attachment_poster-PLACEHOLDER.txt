Placeholder for attachment image.

The user could not upload the binary image here. To replace this placeholder with the real image, add the image file (JPG/PNG) at:

figures/attachment_poster.jpg

Then run:

    git add figures/attachment_poster.jpg
    git commit -m "Add attachment poster image"
    git push

If you want, I can add the image for you if you upload it through the chat file uploader.
